# WhatAboutApp
The Easy Social-Media Profile Reference Tool

## About
Ever talk to someone, but they don't happen to have a Twitter or Facebook? "Well, what about..." is usually the next words out of either party's mouth. Why not WhatAbout- the simple, safe, and easy to share social networking listing app.

Simply sign in, create a list of the social networks you want to share, and you will have a single link you can copy and paste so you can be noticed and found.

WhatAbout is also completely free.

## With WhatAbout
You'll be able to easily link to your favorite social media. Instead of long-winded introductions on Youtube, you can simply provide this tidy link to ensure maximum exposure.

WhatAbout is also great for texting as you can post one link for others to investigate later, instead of blowing up their phone.

Even better, you can create multiple WhatAbout lists with personal and professional emails. This keeps your personal Instagram and Youtube from popping up on your professional lists which might include links to your portfolio or LinkedIn.

## Installing
Installing simply requires an NPM Install. Then kickstart Nodemon and MongoDB in their respective folders to launch your own version of WhatAbout.

## Made With...
HTML5, CSS3, JS, Node.Js, Express, PassportJS, Handlebars, MongoDB, Mongoose and more.
